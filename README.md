# Doctor Directory Web App

This web application is very simple in nature.  No back end or database technologies are used.  A friend simply wanted the ability to add a doctor's basic information to a searchable, updatable table.  Why go to great lengths to deploy a website for this mundane - yet useful - task?  JavaScript's localStorage solution allows any user who replicates this model to store information to his/her browser without actually accessing the internet.  This example could be used for a multitude of data such as: sports, video games, bills, etc.  Although, due to the nature of JavaScript being the sole arbitor of data storage and retrieval, I would absolutely not recommend storing any sensitive data with an application such as this. Enjoy!
